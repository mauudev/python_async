# threading.local() creates an object that looks like a global but is specific to each individual thread. 
# In the example, this is done with thread_local and get_session()
# local() is in the threading module to specifically solve this problem. 
# It looks a little odd, but you only want to create one of these objects, not one for each thread. 
# The object itself takes care of separating accesses from different threads to different data.
# When get_session() is called, the session it looks up is specific to the particular thread on which itâ€™s running. 
# So each thread will create a single session the first time it calls get_session() and then will simply use that session on 
# each subsequent call throughout its lifetime.
